# Initial remarks

The project was carried out with the [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) in mind, we developed incrementally and collected and refined requirements as we went forward with the development. This proved very interesting especially because we were our own stakeholder/product owner since we planned to use the software for ourselves. To ease the Agile development process we first collected user stories (again from ourselves), analyzed them and transformed them in requirements and tasks.
Everthing went mostly according to plan, but in the end, since exams were longer than expected, we decided to not implement some small but not core features (basically a few of the *could* and *want* features) but we still carried out the initial analysis for them.
Since we gave the planning phase enough time we were able to design the project very closely to what the implementation turned out to be. This was definitely a great thing for us and it allowed the implementation to be pretty straigth-forward, basically following design documents. The only changes we had to make to the diagrams after the development were only related to naming differnces, the general workflow was still the same.
